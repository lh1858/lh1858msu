abstract: An agent-based model (ABM) is proposed to represent and analyze the
  self-organization of crime spread in the city of Chicago. Despite the overall
  national reduction in crime, Chicago's crime is still double the national
  average. And in the past year, Chicago's murder rate has been the worst since
  1997. Therefore, methods of analyzing complex systems have become essential in
  predicting crime behavior and movement. Moreover, the interaction between
  criminals and their living environment, the correlation with the migration of
  people, and various circumstantial drivers are considered in building the
  model. The designed ABM will be validated by simulating various experimental
  scenarios, and comparing the results. From observing patterns across location,
  time, and crime type, behavior rules and individual adapting properties are
  determined by using the micro sequential rules. Ideally, the model will be
  valid, simple, and robust. In the end, a crime spread algorithm is proposed,
  which has the potential to be implemented to develop practical
  crime-prevention plans.
