abstract: Electrocardiograms are commonly used to detect cardiovascular
  diseases, so it is important that they are of high quality. However, various
  sources of noise, such as baseline wander, muscle artifact, and electrode
  motion can obfuscate the signal of the heart recorded by different monitors.
  In this work, we propose a novel algorithm, convolutional denoising
  autoencoder with block attention module (CDAE-BAM), for removing noise from
  electrocardiograms by leveraging attention in a convolutional denoising
  autoencoder. We propose an attention block including both spatial and channel
  attention. Spatial attention captures the location of relevant features within
  channels in a signal, and channel attention captures the most relevant
  channels in a signal. We validate our proposed algorithmâ€™s performance in
  removing noise from the MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test Database from
  electrocardiogram signals in the QT Database, the Computing in Cardiology
  Challenge 2017 Database, and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care
  Database. We show that this method outperforms eight other state-of-the-art
  methods with respect to sum of squared distances, mean absolute distance, and
  cosine similarity.
