abstract: The current scheduling templates for attendings and residents in a
  pediatric outpatient clinic of a large urban academic medical center caused
  longer wait times and reduced care access (days to next available appointment)
  to patients. This study proposes an optimization model to design a new
  provider scheduling that (1) establishes new visit types and durations in line
  with patients’ need and time required to complete each visit, and (2) provides
  prompt care for the patients in each of the visit types based on actual
  demands. The proposed scheduling template used seven months of patient visit
  and scheduling data from the electronic health system. We develop a simulation
  model to compare the current and proposed scheduling templates’ performances.
  The results show significant reductions in the average patient wait time and
  average access days based on the proposed templates. Other specialties in
  outpatient settings can use the proposed methodology in redesigning their
  appointment scheduling templates.
