abstract: Hospital readmission prediction continues to be a highly-encouraged
  area of investigation mainly because of the readmissions reduction program by
  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services (CMS). The overall goal is to
  reduce the number of early hospital readmissions by identifying the key risk
  factors that cause hospital readmissions. This is especially important in
  Intensive Care Unit (ICU), where patient readmission increases the likelihood
  of mortality due to the worsening of the patient condition. Traditional
  approaches use simple logistic regression or other linear classification
  methods to identify the key features that provide high prediction accuracy.
  However, these methods are not sufficient since they cannot capture the
  complex patterns between different features. In this paper, we propose a
  hybrid Evolutionary Simulating Annealing LASSO Logistic Regression (ESALOR)
  model to accurately predict the hospital readmission rate and identify the
  important risk factors. The proposed model combines the evolutionary simulated
  annealing method with a sparse logistic regression model of Lasso. The ESALOR
  model was tested on a publicly available diabetes readmission dataset, and the
  results show that the proposed model provides better results compared to
  conventional classification methods including Support Vector Machines (SVM),
  Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression.
