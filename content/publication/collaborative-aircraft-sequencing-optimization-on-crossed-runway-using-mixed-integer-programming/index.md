abstract: In this study, a nonlinear mixed integer programming (NMIP) model is
  developed to solve an aircraft sequencing problem of coordinating arrival and
  departure in a multiple crossed-runway system. The objective is to minimize
  the overall aircraft delay, subject to aircraft types (light (L), medium (M),
  or heavy (H)), and specific separation time between two consecutive aircraft
  activities (departure or arrival) on crossed runways. The proposed NMIP model
  is further solved by using a genetic algorithm. Computational results show
  that the proposed approach provides a better coordinated sequence to reduce
  the overall aircraft delay compared to the commonly used first-come,
  first-served (FCFS) rule.
