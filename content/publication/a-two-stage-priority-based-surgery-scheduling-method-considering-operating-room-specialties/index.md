abstract: In this study, a two-stage multi-objective surgery scheduling method
  for a multiple operating rooms (ORs) system is developed. Minimizing the total
  surgery operation cost (overwork and surgery cancel cost) and OR set up cost
  are considered as the ultimate objectives in this method. Surgery priorities
  are evaluated based on patient age, surgery types, estimated surgery
  durations, and delayed days in the first stage using regression technique. In
  the second stage, the proposed priority-based surgery scheduling optimization
  model considering OR specialties is solved using the discrete harmony search
  (DHS) algorithm. Daily-based experiments are performed and analyzed using
  simulated data sets with 20 and 100 medical records, respectively.
  Experimental results show that the near optimal surgery schedules can be
  obtained efficiently and accurately from the proposed twp-stage surgery
  scheduling method.
