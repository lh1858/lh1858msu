abstract: In this paper, a theoretic approach on the basis of a Markov chain
  model is proposed to analyze the colonoscopy screening process (CSP).
  Colorectal cancer is the one with the second highest death rate in the United
  States. The objective of this study is to provide a quantitative model for
  identifying bottlenecks of CSP and improving the process by analyzing the
  system utilization and the number of served patients. To realize the
  objective, this study proposes a continuous-time Markov chain model for which
  the variability of patient arrival and service cycle times are considered. An
  illustrative example is used to test the effectiveness of this proposed model
  and results indicate that the proposed method is practical and efficient in
  measuring the systemâ€™s performance and identifying the bottlenecks. The
  proposed approach can also be extended to study other care delivery processes
  and improve patient flows for healthcare professionals.
