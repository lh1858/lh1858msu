Abstract: Hospitalized patients who are transferred out from the Intensive Care
  Unit (ICU) but readmitted within three days are considered ICU readmission.
  Compared with general hospital readmission, ICU readmission brings higher
  morbidity and mortality risks along with more financial and labor expenses
  because ICU requires a higher nurse-to-patient ratio and closer monitoring of
  high-risk patients. Early prediction and prevention of potential ICU
  readmission benefits both healthcare providers and patients. In this work, we
  designed an embedded machine learning (ML) system to detect individuals with
  high ICU readmission risk and support healthcare providersâ€™ decisions on
  further interventions based on population health informatics. To discover
  patterns from the sparse and imbalanced ICU data, an algorithm called
  explainable ML with noise reduction (NRL) is proposed to predict patient
  readmission risk and identify controllable variables for early intervention.
  The proposed algorithm is tested on the MIMIC-II and achieved a better
  performance with an improvement of over 113% on sensitivity compared with
  widely utilized models, including logistic regression and decision tree, in
  predicting ICU readmission. A graphical user interface of the embedded machine
  learning system is further designed to illustrate a case study on its
  application in ICU readmission early detection and intervention in practice.
