abstract: The proper allocation of limited hospital bed resources is a complex
  problem caused by uncertainties in patient length of stay, fluctuations in
  demands, unexpected admission decisions, patient recovery status, and other
  factors. Hospitals in the United States usually have a dedicated bed
  allocation team that assigns the beds and works as a bridge between the
  resource departments (such as emergency department (ED), operating rooms (OR),
  labor and delivery (L&D), and referrals) and the inpatient units (such as
  intensive care units (ICU), step-down units, and medical or surgical units).
  Prolonged inpatient length of stay because of non-clinical need increases
  hospitals cost and can reduce patient satisfaction. This paper provides a
  systematic review of recent research on inpatient bed management and evaluates
  a range of problem definitions, measuring metrics, and decision support
  techniques in the reviewed studies. We search related articles from 2013 to
  2017 on Google Scholar, PubMed, and Levy Library databases using keywords such
  as “bed management,” “bed assignment,” “bed planning,” and “bed allocation.”
  We categorize and classify these articles based on the problem settings (e.g.
  various practices, measurement metrics, or in-scope units) and applied
  methodologies (e.g. queueing theory, simulation, integer programming, etc.).
  Moreover, recent research trends, research gaps, and future research
  directions on inpatient bed management are summarized and presented at the end
  of this study. As a high-level conclusion, simulation modeling is the dominant
  technique being used in studying inpatient bed management, and there are
  opportunities in considering system-wide inpatient flow, applying heuristic
  methods, and integrating predictive models in inpatient bed management and
  allocation optimization.
