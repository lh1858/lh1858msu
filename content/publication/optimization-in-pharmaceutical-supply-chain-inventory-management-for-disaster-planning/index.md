  Drug shortages and improper medical inventory management disturbs the pharmacy
  supply chain (PSC) leading to

  poor healthcare service with high cost. Many pharmacies and hospitals experience difficulties in achieving proper

  inventory control as they have not addressed how medicines are managed, supplied, and used. Another important

  factor in the PSC are unknown events such disaster that creates enormous losses. PSC carries high responsibility since

  it is critical that the proper drugs are used at the right time and condition. Medicine and drugs are needed most during

  natural disasters. Preparation for such events must become a priority. To increase the resilience of a PSC for disasters,

  an inventory control model is developed in this study using mathematical programming techniques. The proposed

  model considers various types of medications, expiration dates of products, the lead time, ordering size, holding and

  shortage cost, and the customer service level. The corresponding solution determines the optimal preparation time and

  inventory level in the disaster preparation phase with the minimum overall cost. A scenario of numerical examples

  is performed to illustrate the model application and behaviors. The proposed modeling approach is expected to aid

  inventory strategies to both prepare and respond to disasters with efficiency.
