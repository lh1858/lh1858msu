title: A prediction-optimization approach to surgery prioritization in operating
  room scheduling
abstract: "This study proposes a mixed-integer programming model to optimize
  daily schedules based on surgery priority. Stacking ensemble learning is
  employed to predict surgery priority. The stacking algorithm is composed of
  K-nearest neighbor, multi-nominal logistic regression, decision tree,
  multi-layer perceptron, and ensemble learning. Then, the predicted priorities
  are fed into an optimization model. Six patient-related variables are used to
  predict surgery priority: surgery type, patient acuity, patient age, number of
  delayed days a surgery is postponed, patient age, and surgery time. The study
  contribution comes from integrating machine learning and optimization to
  propose a priority-based decision model for optimally sequencing surgeries
  daily. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is better than
  the current practice in handling unscheduled surgeries, while the scheduling
  cost remains nearly unchanged. We show the effectiveness of the proposed
  approach for handling the surgery cancellation problem in operating room
  systems with high surgery demands."
